# 🌺 Iris Species Classification

## Overview 📊
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify Iris species into one of three types: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. 🌸 I utilize the famous Iris dataset, which includes measurements(length & width) of the sepals and petals of 150 Iris flowers. Two classification models, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree, are trained and evaluated to predict the species based on these features.

## Features 🚀
- **Data Visualization**: Initial data exploration with pair plots to understand the relationships between different features. 📈
- **Data Preprocessing**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. 🧪
- **Model Training**: Implementation of KNN and Decision Tree classifiers. 🤖
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy assessment, confusion matrix, and classification report for model performance evaluation. ✔️

## Requirements 🛠️
- Python 3.x 🐍
- Pandas 🐼
- Numpy 🔢
- Scikit-learn 🧠
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🌊

## Thank you UCI Machine Learning Repository for the dataset
